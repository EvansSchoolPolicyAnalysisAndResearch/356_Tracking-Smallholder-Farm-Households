# 356_Tracking-Smallholder-Farm-Households

This repository includes Stata do.files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) to analyze characteristics of smallholder farm households using data from the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) surveys for Ethiopia and Tanzania. These files were developed as part of the EPAR Tracking Smallholder Farm Households project: https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/tracking-smallholder-farm-households

The .do files in the "AGRA Report do Files" folder can be used to replicate our categorization of households according to the 2017 AGRA Africa Agriculture Status Report 2017 typology of small farm households, and to estimate summary statistics for households by type as reported in the AGRA report and in an EPAR interactive data visualization. We use data from the Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) and Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS). (We note that the estimates reported in the AGRA report represent initial EPAR estimates, so may differ from final results).

The .dta files in the "AGRA Report Supplemental dta Files" were developed by the Agricultural Development team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to segment households in the TNPS and ESS according to ther agricultural and market potential. These data are used in the above .do files, and must be saved alongside the raw TNPS and ESS data from the World Bank in order to run the .do files.

The .do files include all of the code used to categorize farm household and generate summary statistics from the raw survey data for a given survey wave. Click on the green "Clone or Download" button and choose "Download zip" to download a copy of the .do files, and follow the instructions at the top of the .do files to download the raw survey data from the World Bank, update the global filepaths, and run the code.
