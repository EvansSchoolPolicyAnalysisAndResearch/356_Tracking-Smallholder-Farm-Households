# 356_Tracking-Smallholder-Farm-Households

This repository includes Stata do.files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) to analyze characteristics of smallholder farm households using data from the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) surveys for Ethiopia and Tanzania. These files were developed as part of the EPAR Tracking Smallholder Farm Households project: https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/tracking-smallholder-farm-households

The .do files in the "AGRA Report do Files" folder can be used to replicate our categorization of households according to the 2017 AGRA Africa Agriculture Status Report 2017 typology of small farm households, and to estimate summary statistics for households by type as reported in the AGRA report and in an EPAR interactive data visualization. We use data from the Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) and Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS). (We note that the estimates reported in the AGRA report represent initial EPAR estimates, so may differ from final results).

The .do file in the "AGRA Report do Files" folder named "Merging and Cleaning 6.13.19 Year over Year and 16 Categorizations.do" is used to create the underlying Tableau data files for the 16 categories visualization and the Year Over Year Threshold variability visualizations. This file builds off of the household variable files created in EPAR project 335.  The do file has three sections. The first combines the household files for the first three waves of Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Nigeria into a file used in the two subsequent sections. The second section creates a "long" file that documents the households which move across particular smallholder indicator thresholds for different subpopulations.  Due to the way that this is created, we hard code in any disaggregations (such as rural/urban, male headed/female headed etc.) and append them on using loops.  Further explanation of this process can be found int he comments in the file.  The output is used in the Year Over Year Threshold variability viz. The third section prepares the file for use in the 16 categories viz by dropping unused variables.   

The .dta files in the "AGRA Report Supplemental dta Files" were developed by the Agricultural Development team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to segment households in the TNPS and ESS according to ther agricultural and market potential. These data are used in the above .do files, and must be saved alongside the raw TNPS and ESS data from the World Bank in order to run the .do files.

The .do files include all of the code used to categorize farm household and generate summary statistics from the raw survey data for a given survey wave. Click on the green "Clone or Download" button and choose "Download zip" to download a copy of the .do files, and follow the instructions at the top of the .do files to download the raw survey data from the World Bank, update the global filepaths, and run the code.
